# Command History
This challenge asks you to press the up arrow key in order to obtain the flag which is injected into the history.
# My Solve
**Flag**- pwn.college{QMJMphdYRUowpUKSNpQgv-udjpm.0lNzEzNxwyN5EzNzEzW}

We press the up arrow key and navigate through our previous commands so that we can obtain the flag which is injected into our history. 
We can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through our previous commands. 
>hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{QMJMphdYRUowpUKSNpQgv-udjpm.0lNzEzNxwyN5EzNzEzW}

# What I Learned
I learned that there is a log of all of our previous commands executed in the shell and we can access and navigate through our history by using the up and down arrow keys.
We will need to type a lot of commands and typing from scratch can be really tedious and annoying, so this saves a lot of effort and time.
