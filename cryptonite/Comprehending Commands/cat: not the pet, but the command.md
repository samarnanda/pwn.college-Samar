 We use the "cat" command to read the "flag" file. While using the cat command, we put the flag name as argument in the command line. 
 So, the full command will be: cat flag. This will read out the flag file for us and display it on the terminal.

# What I learned
I learned that the "cat" command is used to read a particular file that we provide as the argument. cat can also concatenate multiple files if provided with multiple arguments.
